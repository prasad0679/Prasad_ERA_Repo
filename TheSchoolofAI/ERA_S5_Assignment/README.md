# This Readme contains all the information about the Session 5 Assignment
## Base file ERA_S5.ipynb
### This file consists of the base notebook to train and test the model on MNIST dataset for Digit classification. Below is the code block wise detailed explination 
#### Code Block 1.  
1. Import the necessary Pytorch libraries  
#### Code Block 2. 
1. Check the CUDA availability
2. Copy the model.py into the google colab content
3. Copy the utils.py into the google colab content
4. Import the methods from model.py and utils.py
#### Code Block 3. 
1. Define the data transformations to be performed on training data 
   1.1 Center crop the image to do Data augmentation
   1.2 Resize and perform the Random rotations
   1.3 Standardize and Normalize the data as per overall dataset mean and one std. deviaton
 2. Define the data transformations to be performed on test data 
   2.1
